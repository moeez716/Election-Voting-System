    # Election Voting System

## Introduction
The **Election Voting System** is a web-based platform designed to facilitate secure and efficient online voting. This system allows administrators to manage elections, candidates, and voters while ensuring data integrity and security. The platform is built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**.

This project represents Pakistani culture by incorporating **Halqa numbers**, **National Assembly votes**, and an automated vote counting system.
